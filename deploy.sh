# deploy.sh - Automates deployment of a React project to your PythonAnywhere server
# Usage: ./deploy.sh <project-name>

# 1) Run React build (npm run build)
# 2) Zip contents of dist/ into dist.zip
# 3) Upload dist.zip to server via POST request
# 4) Verify response (operation = success && available[] contains project-name)
# 5) Clean up local build folder if deployment successful

# Exit immediately if any command fails
